---------------------------------
Overview
---------------------------------
This article outlines the testing strategy at Learning Thoughts. The purpose of this strategy is to ensure product quality, reliability, and scalability by implementing standardized testing practices across all projects.

---------------------------------
1. Testing Objectives
---------------------------------
- Detect defects early in the development cycle.
- Ensure software meets functional and non-functional requirements.
- Maintain high test coverage and prevent regressions.
- Provide confidence in delivering stable releases.

---------------------------------
2. Types of Testing
---------------------------------
- **Unit Testing**: Validates individual functions or modules in isolation.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensures different modules work together correctly.
- **System Testing**: Validates the complete application against requirements.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensures new changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Performance Testing**: Measures response time, scalability, and resource usage.
- **Security Testing**: Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures compliance with security standards.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Conducted with end-users to validate usability and business requirements.

---------------------------------
3. Testing Process
---------------------------------
- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) where applicable.
- Define clear test cases before implementation.
- Automate repetitive and critical tests using testing frameworks.
- Use Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines to run automated tests on every commit.
- Perform manual exploratory testing for scenarios difficult to automate.

---------------------------------
4. Tools & Frameworks
---------------------------------
- **Unit Testing**: Jest, Mocha, JUnit, PyTest (depending on language).
- **Integration & E2E Testing**: Selenium, Cypress, Playwright.
- **API Testing**: Postman, Newman, Supertest.
- **Performance Testing**: JMeter, Locust, k6.
- **Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins.

---------------------------------
5. Test Coverage & Metrics
---------------------------------
- Minimum 80% code coverage required for critical projects.
- Track test execution rate, defect density, and defect resolution time.
- Maintain traceability between test cases and requirements.
- Generate automated reports for transparency.

---------------------------------
6. Responsibilities
---------------------------------
- **Developers**: Write unit and integration tests for their code.
- **QA Engineers**: Design and execute test plans, manage test automation, and conduct system/regression testing.
- **DevOps**: Ensure CI/CD pipelines execute tests and maintain environments.
- **Product Owners**: Participate in UAT and validate business requirements.

---------------------------------
7. Best Practices
---------------------------------
- Keep tests deterministic (results should not vary on repeated execution).
- Write small, modular, and reusable test cases.
- Prioritize automation for high-risk and repetitive tasks.
- Involve QA early in the development lifecycle.
- Document all critical test scenarios in the knowledge base.

---------------------------------
Troubleshooting / FAQs
---------------------------------
Q1: What if a test fails during CI/CD?
A1: The build should be blocked until the issue is fixed. Developers must investigate and resolve failures immediately.

Q2: Should all tests be automated?
A2: Not necessarily. Automate repetitive, high-value tests. Keep exploratory and usability testing manual.

Q3: Who approves test cases?
A3: Test cases are reviewed and approved by QA Leads and Project Managers.
