======================================================================

**Purpose:**
To provide the marketing team with a standard procedure for creating and launching a new lead nurturing email campaign using our marketing automation platform, Marketo. This ensures brand consistency and effective tracking.

**Target Audience:** Marketing Associates, Campaign Managers

**Sections:**

1.  **Campaign Setup:**
    * Log in to Marketo and navigate to the "Marketing Activities" section.
    * Create a new program and select the "Nurture" channel.
    * Use the naming convention: `[Region]_[YYYY-MM]_[Campaign Objective]` (e.g., `NA_2025-08_New_Trial_Nurture`).

2.  **Building Your Smart List:**
    * Define the criteria for leads who will enter this nurture stream.
    * Example filters: "Filled out 'Free Trial' form," "Lead Status is 'New'," "Country is 'USA' or 'Canada'."

3.  **Creating Emails:**
    * Use one of the pre-approved XYZ email templates from the "Design Studio".
    * Write compelling copy that aligns with the campaign's goal and the brand voice.
    * Personalize emails using tokens like `{{lead.FirstName}}`.
    * Set up A/B tests for subject lines to optimize open rates. One test per campaign is mandatory.

4.  **Designing the Nurture Flow:**
    * Use the visual flow editor to map out the email sequence.
    * Set the cadence: standard is one email every 3 business days.
    * Use "Wait" steps and "Choice" steps based on lead engagement (e.g., if they clicked a link, send them a different follow-up).

5.  **Activation and Reporting:**
    * Before activating, send a test run to the marketing test list.
    * Activate the campaign.
    * Monitor performance using the campaign dashboard. Key metrics to watch: Open Rate, Click-Through Rate (CTR), and MQL (Marketing Qualified Lead) conversion rate.
