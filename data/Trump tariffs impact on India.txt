1. Trump's Additional 25% Tariff on India
The United States formally imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising total duties to 50% from August 27, 2025, based on Executive Order 14329 by President Trump. This escalation targets India's continued purchase of Russian oil and signals a period of economic friction between the two trading partners. India’s leadership condemned the move as unjustified and stressed protection of domestic interests, like farmers and small businesses.

2. US Tariff on India - Deadline and Notices
The US Department of Homeland Security set a deadline of August 27, 2025, for heightened 50% tariff rates on Indian goods. These secondary tariffs, termed "aggressive economic leverage," focus on pressuring India over its ties with Russia. Exemptions are being considered for select goods. India continues trade talks and asserts the measures as "unjustified and unreasonable," with its leadership prioritizing MSMEs.

3. US Issues Draft Order for Extra 25% Tariff
A draft order outlines the new 25% additional tariff on all Indian products consumed in the US from August 27, 2025. The increased tariffs link directly to US concerns over India's Russian crude oil procurement. Indian government officials state their readiness to endure the impact and bolster local economic resilience, highlighting priorities for farmers and SMEs.

4. Trump’s 25% Tariff - Timeline and Impact
Key events include reciprocal tariffs announced in April, initial 25% tariffs from August 1, and the executive order for the new 25% increase effective August 27. Exemptions exist for pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, energy, and critical minerals. The doubling of tariffs to 50% exposes textiles, gems, leather, chemicals, and auto components, accounting for about 55% of India’s exports to the US.

5. Economic Impact and Exceptions
Pharmaceuticals, electronics, and energy resources remain exempt. The tariffs put pressure on India’s $87 billion export industry, with MSMEs facing intense competition due to higher rates compared to Vietnam and Bangladesh. The Indian rupee has weakened, and sectors like textiles and gems are hit hardest. India is responding diplomatically and considering its own retaliatory moves.

6. US-India Trade Policy Changes
In July 2025, Trump announced the initial 25% tariff on Indian exports due to ongoing purchases from Russia. A second 25% tariff followed, making total duties 50%. Financial analysts estimate a direct export loss of 0.3–0.4% of India’s GDP, especially affecting sectors like pharmaceuticals, textiles, and IT services.

7. Key Affected Sectors and Products
The following products now face up to 50% tariffs: textiles & apparel, gems & jewellery, leather & footwear, marine products, chemicals, auto parts, iron/steel/aluminium, agricultural goods, engineering goods, and dairy products. Notably, pharmaceuticals, electronics, energy, and critical minerals remain unaffected, cushioning some high-value exports.

8. Political Motivations and Diplomatic Standoff
The US justifies tariffs under "national security" (Section 232) and "unfair trade practices" (Section 301), citing India’s energy dealings with Russia and BRICS membership. India denounces Western double standards and highlights continued US and EU trade with Russia. Trade talks remain active but contentious.

9. Market and Currency Reactions
Despite tariff fears, Indian stock indices (Sensex, Nifty) gained on tariff announcement dates, mainly due to sectoral exemptions. The Nifty Pharma index rose due to pharmaceutical exemptions, while exports of engineering goods may drop by $4–5 billion. Currency depreciation and capital flight risks are rising as foreign investor inflows have turned volatile.

10. India's Strategic Response and Future Outlook
India calls the tariffs "economic blackmail," stressing national sovereignty in energy decisions. The government is working diplomatically, supporting impacted export sectors, and exploring alternative trade markets. If negotiations fail, India may introduce its own tariffs and accelerate its self-reliance agenda. The tariffs demonstrate the limitations of WTO mediation and the volatility of global geopolitics.
