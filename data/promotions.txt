HR Policy: Employee Promotion Guidelines

Overview

The promotion policy defines the framework and criteria for advancing employees to higher roles within the organization. It ensures transparency, merit-based recognition, and alignment with organizational growth needs.

Steps
Step 1: Types of Promotions

Vertical Promotion: Movement to a higher designation with increased responsibilities and pay.

Horizontal Promotion: Change in role or department at the same level, usually for skill enhancement.

Dry Promotion: Change in title or role without an immediate salary increase (rare and subject to approval).

Step 2: Eligibility Criteria

Minimum Tenure: Employees must complete at least 12 months in their current role unless an exception is approved.

Performance Rating: Consistent ‘Meets Expectations’ or above in the last two appraisal cycles.

Skill and Competency: The employee must demonstrate the necessary skills and qualifications for the higher role.

Behavioral Fit: Alignment with company values and leadership competencies.

Step 3: Promotion Process

Recommendation: The reporting manager initiates a promotion recommendation during the appraisal cycle or through a special request.

Evaluation:

HR and the department head assess performance history, skills, and eligibility.

For certain roles, an internal interview or assessment may be conducted.

Approval: Final approval from senior management and HR.

Communication: The employee receives an official promotion letter detailing the new role, responsibilities, and compensation (if applicable).

Step 4: Effective Date

Promotions are effective from the date mentioned in the promotion letter, usually aligned with the appraisal cycle or as per business need.

Notes

Promotions are based on merit and organizational requirements; there is no automatic entitlement.

Salary adjustments for promotions are handled as per the Salary Revision Policy.

Employees on PIP (Performance Improvement Plan) or under disciplinary review are not eligible for promotions.

Promotions may involve a probation period in the new role.
