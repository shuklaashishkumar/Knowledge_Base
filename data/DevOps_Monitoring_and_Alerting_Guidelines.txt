---------------------------------
Overview
---------------------------------
This article defines the Monitoring & Alerting Guidelines at Learning Thoughts. The goal is to ensure system reliability, quick detection of issues, and proactive incident management for applications and infrastructure.

---------------------------------
1. Objectives
---------------------------------
- Ensure high availability and reliability of systems.
- Detect anomalies and failures in real-time.
- Reduce Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR).
- Provide actionable alerts to the right teams.

---------------------------------
2. Monitoring Best Practices
---------------------------------
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Track CPU, memory, disk usage, and network traffic using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or CloudWatch.
- **Application Monitoring**: Monitor response times, error rates, and throughput with APM tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog).
- **Log Monitoring**: Centralize logs using ELK Stack or Graylog for faster debugging.
- **Database Monitoring**: Track query performance, replication lag, and connection pools.
- **Business Metrics**: Monitor KPIs such as user signups, transactions, and revenue-impacting metrics.

---------------------------------
3. Alerting Best Practices
---------------------------------
- **Threshold-Based Alerts**: Define thresholds for CPU usage, error rates, or latency.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Use machine learning-based anomaly detection for dynamic workloads.
- **Severity Levels**: Classify alerts into Critical, High, Medium, and Low.
- **Reduce Noise**: Avoid alert fatigue by fine-tuning alert thresholds and eliminating duplicates.
- **Escalation Policies**: Ensure critical alerts reach the right on-call engineer immediately.

---------------------------------
4. Incident Management
---------------------------------
- **On-Call Rotation**: Maintain an on-call schedule for DevOps and support teams.
- **Alert Channels**: Use Slack, Microsoft Teams, or PagerDuty for alert notifications.
- **Incident Response**: Document steps for diagnosing and resolving incidents.
- **Postmortems**: Conduct blameless postmortems for critical incidents to identify root causes and preventive measures.

---------------------------------
5. Dashboards & Visualization
---------------------------------
- Create dashboards for real-time visibility into system health.
- Use Grafana or Kibana for visualization of metrics and logs.
- Ensure dashboards display critical KPIs, error trends, and latency over time.
- Provide role-based dashboards (DevOps, QA, Business Owners).

---------------------------------
6. Security Monitoring
---------------------------------
- Monitor unauthorized access attempts and suspicious activities.
- Track API usage, firewall logs, and intrusion detection systems (IDS).
- Enable audit logging for compliance and regulatory requirements.
- Integrate alerts with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools.

---------------------------------
7. Best Practices for Teams
---------------------------------
- Review monitoring and alerting rules regularly.
- Conduct mock incident drills to improve response times.
- Document monitoring setup and alert policies for each service.
- Foster a culture of proactive monitoring rather than reactive firefighting.

---------------------------------
Troubleshooting / FAQs
---------------------------------
Q1: What tools are recommended for monitoring at Learning Thoughts?
A1: Prometheus + Grafana for infrastructure, ELK Stack for logs, and New Relic/Datadog for APM.

Q2: How do we prevent false alarms?
A2: Fine-tune thresholds, use anomaly detection, and validate alerts before escalation.

Q3: What should I do when I receive a critical alert?
A3: Acknowledge immediately, investigate logs and metrics, and follow the incident response playbook.
