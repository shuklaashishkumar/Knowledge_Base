Overview
---------------------------------
This article describes the CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) best practices at Learning Thoughts. The goal is to ensure faster, reliable, and automated delivery of software with minimal risk.

---------------------------------
1. Continuous Integration (CI) Best Practices
---------------------------------
- **Frequent Commits**: Developers should commit small changes frequently to reduce integration issues.
- **Automated Builds**: Every commit triggers an automated build to validate code integrity.
- **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, and regression tests must run automatically in the CI pipeline.
- **Static Code Analysis**: Integrate tools like SonarQube or ESLint for code quality checks.
- **Fail Fast Principle**: Builds must fail immediately upon detecting errors, preventing faulty code from progressing.
- **Test Coverage Enforcement**: Maintain minimum 80% code coverage for critical services.

---------------------------------
2. Continuous Deployment (CD) Best Practices
---------------------------------
- **Staged Environments**: Use separate environments (dev, staging, production) for controlled deployments.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use tools like Terraform or Ansible for environment consistency.
- **Automated Rollbacks**: Implement rollback strategies in case of deployment failures.
- **Blue-Green / Canary Deployments**: Reduce downtime and risk by gradually rolling out changes.
- **Database Migration Strategy**: Automate schema migrations with version control (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase).

---------------------------------
3. Security in CI/CD
---------------------------------
- **Secrets Management**: Store credentials and API keys securely (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- **Dependency Scanning**: Scan third-party libraries for vulnerabilities.
- **Access Control**: Restrict pipeline access based on roles and enforce MFA.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain logs of all pipeline executions and deployments for compliance.

---------------------------------
4. Monitoring & Feedback
---------------------------------
- **Pipeline Monitoring**: Track build times, failure rates, and bottlenecks.
- **Application Monitoring**: Integrate APM tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic).
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for failed builds, test failures, or deployment issues.
- **Feedback Loop**: Provide quick feedback to developers to improve quality and speed.

---------------------------------
5. Collaboration & Governance
---------------------------------
- **Code Reviews**: All changes must pass peer review before merging into main branches.
- **Branch Protection Rules**: Protect `main` and `develop` branches with mandatory checks.
- **Documentation**: Maintain pipeline documentation for setup, usage, and troubleshooting.
- **Training**: Conduct periodic training for developers and DevOps engineers on CI/CD best practices.

---------------------------------
6. Tools Commonly Used at Learning Thoughts
---------------------------------
- **CI/CD Platforms**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
- **Testing**: Jest, Cypress, Postman, PyTest
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

---------------------------------
Troubleshooting / FAQs
---------------------------------
Q1: What happens if my build fails?
A1: The pipeline stops, and the developer must fix the issue before merging code.

Q2: Can I deploy directly to production?
A2: No. All deployments must go through the staging environment unless approved by management.

Q3: How are secrets managed in pipelines?
A3: Secrets are stored in secure vaults and injected into pipelines only when required.
