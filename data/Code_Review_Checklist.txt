---------------------------------
Overview
---------------------------------
This article provides a standardized Code Review Checklist for Learning Thoughts. The purpose is to ensure consistency, maintainability, performance, and security in all code submissions.

---------------------------------
1. Readability & Style
---------------------------------
- Code follows the agreed-upon coding standards and naming conventions.
- Proper indentation and formatting are applied.
- Variable, function, and class names are meaningful and self-explanatory.
- Code avoids unnecessary complexity and is easy to understand.

---------------------------------
2. Functionality & Correctness
---------------------------------
- The code implements the intended feature or bug fix correctly.
- All requirements from the specification or task ticket are met.
- Edge cases and error scenarios are handled properly.
- There are no logical errors or broken functionality.

---------------------------------
3. Performance & Efficiency
---------------------------------
- Code avoids unnecessary computations or database queries.
- Loops and iterations are optimized.
- Large datasets are handled efficiently with appropriate data structures.
- Performance trade-offs are justified and documented.

---------------------------------
4. Security & Privacy
---------------------------------
- No hardcoded credentials, API keys, or secrets in the codebase.
- Input validation and sanitization are implemented to prevent injection attacks.
- Sensitive data is encrypted and never logged.
- Access control and authentication checks are in place.

---------------------------------
5. Testing & Quality
---------------------------------
- Unit tests are written for new functions and modules.
- Existing tests are updated if necessary.
- Code coverage is maintained or improved.
- All automated tests pass successfully in the CI/CD pipeline.

---------------------------------
6. Documentation & Comments
---------------------------------
- Code is self-explanatory, with comments where necessary.
- Functions and classes include docstrings for clarity.
- README or related documentation is updated if the change impacts usage.
- Inline comments explain complex logic but do not state the obvious.

---------------------------------
7. Version Control & Git Practices
---------------------------------
- Commits are small, frequent, and focused on a single change.
- Commit messages are clear, concise, and descriptive.
- No unnecessary files (logs, build outputs, environment files) are committed.
- Branch naming follows the defined convention (e.g., feature/, bugfix/).

---------------------------------
8. Maintainability & Scalability
---------------------------------
- Code adheres to DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles.
- No dead or commented-out code is left behind.
- Modules and functions are reusable and modular.
- Code changes are future-proof and scalable for growth.

---------------------------------
9. Review Process
---------------------------------
- Reviewer confirms code runs successfully in a local environment (if applicable).
- Feedback is constructive, specific, and actionable.
- Both author and reviewer ensure clarity in communication.
- Code is approved only when all checklist items are satisfied.

---------------------------------
Troubleshooting / FAQs
---------------------------------
Q1: What if I find minor issues that don’t block merging?
A1: Approve with comments, so the author can fix them later.

Q2: How do I handle disagreements in review feedback?
A2: Discuss openly with the team lead or architect. Prioritize team standards over personal preference.

Q3: Should I prioritize speed or thoroughness in reviews?
A3: Aim for balance. Avoid rushing, but ensure reviews don’t block delivery unnecessarily.
