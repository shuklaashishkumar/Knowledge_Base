Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) Policy of Learning Thoughts

Overview

The Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) Policy outlines the structured process for addressing employee performance that falls below expectations. It provides clear objectives, support, and timelines for improvement, ensuring fairness and transparency while maintaining organizational productivity.

Steps / Guidelines
Step 1: Identification of Performance Issues

Employees may be placed on a PIP if their performance is consistently rated “Needs Improvement” or “Unsatisfactory” during performance evaluations.

Managers document specific performance gaps and provide examples of underperformance.

HR and the reporting manager collaborate to determine if a PIP is appropriate.

Step 2: PIP Initiation

The employee is formally notified in writing, detailing:

Specific performance issues

Expected outcomes and improvement targets

Duration of the PIP (typically 30–90 days)

The notification includes available support, such as training, mentoring, or resources.

Step 3: PIP Objectives and Plan

Set clear, measurable, and achievable goals aligned with the employee’s role.

Define key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress.

Establish regular check-ins between the manager and employee to monitor improvement.

Step 4: Monitoring and Support

Managers provide guidance, feedback, and coaching throughout the PIP period.

Employees are expected to actively engage, ask questions, and implement feedback.

HR may conduct mid-point reviews to assess progress and provide additional support if necessary.

Step 5: Evaluation and Outcome

At the end of the PIP period, performance is reviewed against the defined objectives.

Possible outcomes include:

Successful Completion: Employee meets expectations; PIP is closed.

Partial Improvement: PIP may be extended with revised goals.

Unsuccessful: Continued underperformance may lead to role change, demotion, or termination.

The outcome is documented in HR records, and the employee is provided written feedback.

Notes

PIP is intended as a supportive and corrective measure, not a punitive action.

Employees on PIP are expected to actively participate and demonstrate commitment to improvement.

PIP outcomes are factored into future performance ratings, promotions, and salary reviews.

Confidentiality of the PIP process must be maintained by both managers and employees.
