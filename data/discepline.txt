HR Policy: Disciplinary Action

Overview

The Disciplinary Action Policy defines the process and procedures for addressing violations of company policies, unethical behavior, or misconduct by employees. The policy ensures fairness, transparency, and consistency while maintaining a professional work environment.

Steps
Step 1: Scope of Disciplinary Action

The policy applies to all employees of the organization, including permanent, probationary, and contractual staff.

Disciplinary actions may be initiated for:

Violation of company policies (e.g., Attendance, Code of Conduct, WFH)

Unethical behavior, harassment, or misconduct

Non-performance or repeated negligence

Damage to company property or confidential information

Step 2: Types of Disciplinary Actions

Verbal Warning: First level of action for minor infractions.

Written Warning: Documented warning for repeated or serious violations.

Suspension: Temporary removal from duties, with or without pay, depending on severity.

Demotion: Reduction in role or responsibilities for performance or conduct-related reasons.

Termination: Permanent separation from the organization for severe or repeated violations.

Step 3: Investigation Process

HR or the designated authority conducts a fact-finding investigation.

Employees may be asked to provide explanations or supporting documents.

The investigation ensures impartiality and confidentiality.

Step 4: Decision and Communication

The reporting manager, HR, and senior management review investigation findings.

Appropriate disciplinary action is determined based on severity, recurrence, and impact.

The employee receives a formal notification letter detailing the action and reasons.

Step 5: Appeal Process

Employees may appeal disciplinary actions to HR or higher management within 7 days of notification.

Appeals are reviewed objectively, and final decisions are communicated in writing.

Notes

Disciplinary actions are not punitive but aim to correct behavior and maintain workplace standards.

All actions are documented in the employeeâ€™s HR record.

Employees are expected to cooperate fully during investigations.

In cases of legal implications, external authorities may be involved.
