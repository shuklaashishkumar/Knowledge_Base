HR Policy: Work From Home (WFH)

Overview

The Work From Home (WFH) policy defines the guidelines, eligibility, and expectations for employees working remotely. This policy ensures continuity of work, maintains productivity, and provides flexibility while aligning with organizational goals.

Steps
Step 1: Eligibility for WFH

Employees must have completed the probation period to be eligible, unless otherwise approved by management.

Eligibility is subject to role suitability, team requirements, and manager approval.

Certain critical functions or roles may require on-site presence regardless of WFH requests.

Step 2: Requesting WFH

Submit a WFH request through the HR portal or via email to your reporting manager.

Requests should be made at least 24 hours in advance for planned WFH days.

Emergency WFH requests should be communicated as soon as possible.

Step 3: Working Hours and Attendance

Employees must adhere to regular working hours unless prior flexible arrangements are approved.

Attendance must be marked via the online attendance system.

Employees should be available online on communication platforms (e.g., Teams, Slack) during working hours.

Step 4: Work Environment and Equipment

Ensure a safe and distraction-free workspace at home.

Use company-provided devices and tools for work-related tasks.

Maintain data privacy and follow IT security guidelines.

Step 5: Deliverables and Communication

Employees are expected to complete assigned tasks on time and maintain productivity standards.

Maintain regular communication with the manager and team through calls, emails, or virtual meetings.

Report any issues with connectivity, tools, or deliverables promptly.

Notes

WFH is a privilege, not a right, and can be revoked if guidelines are not followed.

Employees must adhere to all other HR and company policies while working remotely.

Any misrepresentation of WFH status or failure to meet deliverables may result in disciplinary action.

Company reserves the right to request on-site presence at any time based on business needs.
