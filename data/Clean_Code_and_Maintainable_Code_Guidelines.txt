---------------------------------
Overview
---------------------------------
This article outlines the best practices for writing clean and maintainable code at Learning Thoughts. The goal is to ensure code readability, scalability, and long-term maintainability across all projects.

---------------------------------
1. General Principles
---------------------------------
- Write code that is easy to read and understand.
- Optimize for clarity rather than cleverness.
- Follow consistent coding standards and style guides.
- Prioritize simplicity and avoid unnecessary complexity.

---------------------------------
2. Naming Conventions
---------------------------------
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and files.
- Follow camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes, and snake_case for database fields.
- Avoid abbreviations unless universally accepted (e.g., `id`, `URL`).

---------------------------------
3. Code Structure & Organization
---------------------------------
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Break large files into smaller, logical modules.
- Group related files and functions into well-defined directories.
- Maintain proper indentation and formatting.

---------------------------------
4. Comments & Documentation
---------------------------------
- Write self-explanatory code; use comments only when necessary.
- Document complex algorithms, business logic, and edge cases.
- Maintain up-to-date README files for repositories.
- Use docstrings for functions, classes, and APIs.

---------------------------------
5. Error Handling & Logging
---------------------------------
- Handle exceptions gracefully with meaningful error messages.
- Avoid silent failures; log errors for debugging.
- Use standardized logging frameworks instead of custom print statements.
- Ensure sensitive data is never logged.

---------------------------------
6. Testing & Quality Assurance
---------------------------------
- Write unit tests for all critical functions and modules.
- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) when possible.
- Use automated testing tools and Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines.
- Maintain high code coverage without writing unnecessary tests.

---------------------------------
7. Version Control Practices
---------------------------------
- Use Git for all projects.
- Commit frequently with clear, concise messages.
- Use feature branches for new development and pull requests for code reviews.
- Avoid committing sensitive data (API keys, passwords, etc.).

---------------------------------
8. Maintainability Practices
---------------------------------
- Refactor code regularly to improve structure without changing functionality.
- Remove dead code, unused functions, and outdated comments.
- Follow DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles.
- Ensure backward compatibility where applicable.

---------------------------------
9. Code Reviews
---------------------------------
- All code must be reviewed before merging into main branches.
- Reviews should focus on correctness, readability, and maintainability.
- Provide constructive feedback, not criticism.
- Encourage pair programming when necessary.

---------------------------------
Troubleshooting / FAQs
---------------------------------
Q1: How do I ensure my code is “clean”?
A1: Ask yourself: Can another developer understand my code without asking me questions? If yes, it’s clean.

Q2: What if performance conflicts with clean code?
A2: Always prioritize readability first. Optimize performance only after identifying bottlenecks.

Q3: Who is responsible for enforcing guidelines?
A3: Every developer is responsible. Leads and reviewers ensure compliance during reviews.
