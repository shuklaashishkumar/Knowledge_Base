HR Policy: Employee Leave Management

Overview

This policy outlines the rules and guidelines for availing different types of leaves within the organization. It ensures transparency, compliance, and proper workforce planning. All employees are required to adhere to the leave policy to maintain smooth business operations.

Steps
Step 1: Types of Leaves Available

Casual Leave (CL): Short-term leave for personal reasons or emergencies.

Sick Leave (SL): Leave granted for health-related issues.

Earned Leave (EL) / Paid Time Off (PTO): Leave earned over time, typically planned in advance.

Maternity Leave: Leave for female employees as per statutory norms.

Paternity Leave: Leave for male employees during childbirth.

Bereavement Leave: Leave granted for the demise of an immediate family member.

Unpaid Leave: When all paid leave options are exhausted.

Step 2: Leave Application Process

Submit leave requests through the company’s HR portal or email to your reporting manager.

Apply at least 3 working days in advance for planned leaves (Earned Leave, PTO).

Emergency leaves (Casual or Sick) must be informed at the earliest via email or phone.

Attach relevant documents for Sick Leave exceeding 2 consecutive days (e.g., medical certificate).

Step 3: Leave Approval Process

The reporting manager reviews the leave request based on team workload and project requirements.

The HR department updates the leave balance upon approval.

Employees receive an email confirmation once leave is approved or rejected.

Step 4: Carry Forward and Encashment

Casual and Sick Leaves cannot usually be carried forward unless specified by company policy.

Earned Leave may be carried forward to the next year as per organizational guidelines.

Encashment of Earned Leave is allowed at the end of the financial year or during separation, based on company rules.
