---------------------------------
Overview
---------------------------------
This article provides guidelines for Incident Management and Postmortems at Learning Thoughts. The purpose is to minimize downtime, ensure rapid recovery, and learn from incidents to prevent future occurrences.

---------------------------------
1. Objectives
---------------------------------
- Detect and respond to incidents quickly and efficiently.
- Reduce Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR).
- Communicate effectively during incidents.
- Conduct blameless postmortems to learn from failures.

---------------------------------
2. Incident Definition
---------------------------------
An **incident** is any unplanned disruption to a service, system, or process that impacts business operations, customers, or employees. Examples include:
- Application downtime
- Data breaches or security threats
- Performance degradation
- Infrastructure failures

---------------------------------
3. Incident Severity Levels
---------------------------------
- **Critical (P1)**: Complete outage or severe impact on business-critical systems.
- **High (P2)**: Major functionality is broken but partial workarounds exist.
- **Medium (P3)**: Minor service disruption with limited business impact.
- **Low (P4)**: Cosmetic issues or non-urgent bugs.

---------------------------------
4. Incident Management Process
---------------------------------
- **Detection**: Automated monitoring or user-reported.
- **Triage**: Classify severity and assign ownership.
- **Response**: Contain, mitigate, and resolve the incident.
- **Communication**: Notify stakeholders and update status channels.
- **Resolution**: Restore service and validate normal operations.

---------------------------------
5. Roles & Responsibilities
---------------------------------
- **Incident Commander (IC)**: Coordinates response, assigns tasks, ensures communication.
- **Technical Lead**: Diagnoses technical root causes and leads resolution efforts.
- **Communications Lead**: Provides timely updates to stakeholders and customers.
- **Scribe/Recorder**: Maintains incident timeline, actions, and key decisions.

---------------------------------
6. Communication Protocol
---------------------------------
- Use predefined channels (Slack, Teams, email) for incident updates.
- Send status updates every 30â€“60 minutes for critical incidents.
- Maintain transparency with customers through status pages when applicable.
- Escalate to management if incident exceeds defined thresholds.

---------------------------------
7. Postmortem Guidelines
---------------------------------
- **Blameless Culture**: Focus on process and system improvements, not individuals.
- **Timeline Documentation**: Record incident start, detection, actions taken, and resolution time.
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: Identify underlying cause(s), not just symptoms.
- **Action Items**: Define preventive measures, assign owners, and set deadlines.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Document postmortems in the KB for learning across teams.

---------------------------------
8. Preventive Measures
---------------------------------
- Improve monitoring and alert thresholds to catch issues early.
- Regularly test disaster recovery and failover systems.
- Automate repetitive recovery tasks where possible.
- Conduct periodic incident response drills.

---------------------------------
