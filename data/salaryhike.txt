HR Policy: Salary Hike and Increment Guidelines

Overview

The salary hike policy defines the structure, frequency, and eligibility criteria for employee salary revisions within the organization. It ensures fairness, performance-based growth, and compliance with organizational and market standards.

Steps
Step 1: Eligibility for Salary Hike

All confirmed employees who have completed the minimum tenure of 12 months with the organization are eligible for an annual increment, unless otherwise specified.

Employees on probation or under performance improvement plans (PIP) are generally not eligible for salary hikes.

Salary increments are linked to performance ratings, business performance, and market benchmarks.

Step 2: Salary Review Cycle

Salary revision is typically conducted once a year, aligned with the company’s financial year (e.g., April to March).

Exceptional increments may be considered for promotions, critical skill retention, or outstanding performance.

Step 3: Performance Evaluation

The annual performance review process determines eligibility and percentage of increment.

Employees receive a performance rating (e.g., Outstanding, Exceeds Expectations, Meets Expectations, Needs Improvement).

Higher performance ratings correspond to higher increments.

Step 4: Approval Process

The reporting manager recommends the increment based on the appraisal outcome.

Department heads and HR review the recommendation for consistency.

Final approval is given by senior management and the finance department.

Employees are notified of the revised salary through an official increment letter.

Step 5: Communication of Increment

Salary hike letters are distributed during the annual appraisal cycle.

The letter includes the effective date, revised CTC, and increment percentage.

Notes

Increments are not guaranteed and depend on company performance, budget allocation, and individual contribution.

Employees who resign during the increment cycle or before the effective date are not eligible.

Any salary revision outside the cycle requires management approval.

Market adjustments or cost of living adjustments may also influence increment decisions.
