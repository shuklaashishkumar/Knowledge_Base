📌 Guidelines

Use numbers to keep folders in logical order.

Keep naming consistent — use underscores _ or PascalCase.

README.md should explain the purpose of the project and folder contents.

Move outdated or unused files to the 06_Archive folder to reduce clutter.

Backups should be scheduled weekly and stored securely.
