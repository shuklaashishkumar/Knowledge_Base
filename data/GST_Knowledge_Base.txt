Goods and Services Tax (GST) Knowledge Base
==========================================

1. What is GST?
- GST is the Goods and Services Tax, a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based tax levied on the supply of goods and services in India. It replaced various indirect taxes like excise duty, VAT, and service tax with a single unified tax structure. Introduced on July 1, 2017, it aims for “One Nation, One Tax.”

2. Key Principles of GST
- Multi-stage: Tax is applied at each stage in the supply chain – production, warehousing, wholesaling, retailing.
- Value addition: GST is charged on the added value at every stage, not on the total transaction value.
- Destination-based: Tax is levied at the location where goods or services are consumed, not where produced.

3. Types of GST
- Central GST (CGST): Levied by the Central Government on intra-state transactions.
- State GST (SGST): Levied by State Governments on intra-state transactions.
- Integrated GST (IGST): Levied by the Central Government on inter-state transactions and imports/exports, credited to both Centre and importing State.
- Union Territory GST (UTGST): Levied by Union Territory Governments on intra-UT transactions.

4. Calculation of GST
- GST applies to the taxable value, calculated as the transaction amount minus any discounts or abatements.
- Example: If a product’s taxable value is ₹1,000 and GST rate is 18%, total GST = ₹180 (split between CGST and SGST for intra-state, or IGST for inter-state).

5. Input Tax Credit (ITC)
- Businesses can offset the GST paid on inputs (raw materials, services used) against the GST collected on sales, thereby reducing tax cost and preventing tax cascading.
- ITC conditions: Registration under GST, valid tax invoice, and business use of inputs.

6. Uniformity and Transparency
- GST brings uniform tax rates across India by replacing multiple central/state taxes. The main GST slabs are 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%.
- Online GST processes (such as registration, filing returns) further streamline compliance and transparency.

7. Compliance Basics
- GST registration can be done online at gst.gov.in.
- Regular returns (monthly, quarterly, annual) are required.
- Timely payment and filing avoid penalties.

8. FAQs
- Who pays GST? The consumer ultimately bears the tax, but businesses are responsible for payment and remittance to the government.
- Where does GST revenue go? Shared between Central and State Governments; vital for national operations.
- Can I apply for GST myself? Yes, via government portals.
- What is Dual GST? Both Centre and State levy GST on a common base (CGST+SGST/IGST).
